Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?

Our users are anyone who's ever needed to look for a new beer, anyone who wants to keep track of ones they've tried, and anyone who'd like to see reviews from other avid beer enthusiast.

As a user I'd love a place where I can come and see what drinks i should try next and what others have liked. Good Spirits is that place for me.  I can see what drinks are popular, I can see things i've tried and loved, I can search for new drinks, and I can write and read reviews of the various ones. It is easy for me to login and when I do I always find myself in Good Spirits.
