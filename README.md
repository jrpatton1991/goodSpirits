# goodSpirits

###Technologies used
We created the websites backend using node.js and express. The front end was bootstrap and jquery.

###The approach we took
* Planned out what needed to be done.
* Negotiated what skills were needed to achieve each goal of functionality.
* Assessed what was needed for MVP verses what was wanted as stretch goals.
* Divied out assignments to teammates based on strengths and interests.
* Created a wireframe for how we wanted things to go,
* Whiteboarded information at different stages of the project.


###Installation

All of the dependencies can be obtained buy using NPM Install. For the server side scripts we used CDN's.


###User stories

Our users are anyone who's ever needed to look for a new beer, anyone who wants to keep track of ones they've tried, and anyone who'd like to see reviews from other avid beer enthusiast.

As a user I'd love a place where I can come and see what drinks i should try next and what others have liked. Good Spirits is that place for me.  I can see what drinks are popular, I can see things i've tried and loved, I can search for new drinks, and I can write and read reviews of the various ones. It is easy for me to login and when I do I always find myself in Good Spirits.
