# goodSpirits

###Technologies Used
* Frontend
⋅⋅* Bootstrap & CSS 
⋅⋅* jQuery  
⋅⋅* HTML & EJS  

* Backend
⋅⋅* node.js
⋅⋅* express 

###Approach

* First we needed to plan out all of the larger necessities to get the MVP up and running. We initially decided what API to use, how we would create likes, what pages were needed and would house certain information, and what information would be included in our database. 
⋅⋅* We decided we needed to pull in information from our API that would include all of the information about the beers, but would also need to create our own API that would be a relational database that would house the users that have liked certain beers. 

* As a group, we decided what we all though the app should have and what functionalities it should include. Afterwards we had to assess what was needed for the MVP versus what were "Nice-to-haves". We then decided what would be included in our MVP and what would be left out for out initial build.

* Next, we made a list of all the larger tasks to be completed initially and determined what skills were needed to achieve each goal of functionality and then what group member would work on which tasks. The backend work with node.js was going to be the bulk of the work because we are pulling in so many different types of information from multiple API's. This would be what we designated would take the longest. 

* We then had to begin documenting what the "Plan of action" would be for the project and other misecllaneous whiteboarding.

* Our next step was to begin divying out assignments to teammates based on strengths and interests. 
* Kept a log of what was still needed and what was completed.

###User Stories

Our users are anyone who's ever needed to look for a new beer, anyone who wants to keep track of ones they've tried, and anyone who'd like to see reviews from other avid beer enthusiast.

As a user I'd love a place where I can come and see what drinks i should try next and what others have liked. Good Spirits is that place for me.  I can see what drinks are popular, I can see things i've tried and loved, I can search for new drinks, and I can write and read reviews of the various ones. It is easy for me to login and when I do I always find myself in Good Spirits.
